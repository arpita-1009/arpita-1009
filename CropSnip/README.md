# SnippingToolForProgrammers

# This is a programme that allows the user to snip text on their screen and this text will be automatically recognised and search in google or saved to clipboard. 

# The .exe file will only work on windows and has not been tested on any machine other than mine. 

# Tips for use:
# 1. Copying large chunks of text across multiple lines is likely to result in erroneous text recognition. Short, one line snippets works best. 
# 2. Be mindful that punctuation seem to be harder to recognise.
